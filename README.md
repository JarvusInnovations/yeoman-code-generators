# Jarvus Yeoman Generator

This repository can contain multiple yeoman code generators. Each generator may have its own requirements. See the readme in that directory for specific instructions.

## VS Code

You can develop and debug yeoman generators in VS Code by editing the "args" command in `.vscode/launch.json` as long as the generator being
debugged has been linked globally with `npm link`.
